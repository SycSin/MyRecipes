## Installation
Our application is built to run via Docker on any environment.

### Requirements
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)

### Automated deployment (Linux, OSX)
On Linux or OSX it is recommended to use the `deploy.sh` script in order to deploy the application and load the initial data into the database
This can be done with the following:
```shell
chmod u+x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```
When developing locally, it is recommended to use `http://localhost:3000` as the API via axios on the frontend.

## Manual deployment (Windows, OSX, Linux): 
### Creating the image
In order to create a Docker image the `Dockerfile` as well as the `docker-compose.yml` file are required.

The `Dockerfile` is a sequence of commands for the building process of the image and the `docker-compose.yml` file is required in order to deploy the application.

Issue the following command to build and deploy the application:
```shell
docker-compose up -d --build

```

### Loading the data into the database
```shell
docker exec -i myrecipes-db mysql -uroot -pexample < schema.sql
docker exec -i myrecipes-db mysql -uroot -pexample < seed.sql
````
